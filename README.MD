# [P]ortswigger [A]cademy [A]utomatic [S]olver

#### With this tool, you can solve the labs in PortSwigger Academy with a few commands.

 - [x] Run the tool with the command `./python paas_linux.py`

 - For now, PAAS only available for three categories: Authentication, Directory Traversal and OS Command Injection
 - I will continue to develop the tool. More labs will be added in the future.
