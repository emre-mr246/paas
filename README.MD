# [P]ortswigger [A]cademy [A]utomatic [S]olver
#### With this tool, you can solve the labs in PortSwigger Academy with a few commands.
 - For now, PAAS only available for four categories: Authentication, Directory Traversal, OS Command Injection and Access Control Vulnerabilities
 - I'm developing the tool. More labs will be added in the future.
 
#### Usage
 - [x] Burp Suite and browser must be open while the PAAS is running and browser's proxy settings must be set.
 - [x] Run the tool with the command `./python paas_linux.py`.
 - [x] Type `exit` to exit the tool, and `menu` to return to the main menu.
