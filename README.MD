# [P]ortswigger [A]cademy [A]utomatic [S]olver

#### With this tool, you can solve the labs in PortSwigger Academy with a few commands.

 - [x] Run the tool with the command `./python paas_linux.py`

 - For now, only the labs under the authentication and directory
   traversal menu are working. 
  - I will continue to develop the tool. More
   labs will be added in the future.
