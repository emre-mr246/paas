 # [P]ortswigger [A]cademy [A]utomatic [S]olver
#### With this tool, you can easily solve labs in PortSwigger Academy using just a few commands.
 - PAAS available for seven vulnerability categories: Authentication, Directory Traversal, OSCi, Access Control Vulnerabilities, SSRF (Python) and SQLi (C).
 - PAAS is designed for Linux.
 - Burp Suite or any proxy listener (on 127.0.0.1:8080) must be open while the PAAS is running.
 - You can see requests through the Burp Suite's HTTP history.
 - I'm preparing for Ecole 42, and since for loops are prohibited there, I use mostly while loops instead.
